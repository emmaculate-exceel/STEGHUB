# Devops tooling solution 101


#### Setting up tooling websites


---

The tools we want our team to be able to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so we will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:

1. Jenkins - free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.

2. Kubernetes - an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

3. Jfrog Artifactory - Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.

4. Rancher - an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.

5. Grafana - a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

6. Prometheus - An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

7. Kibana - Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.
