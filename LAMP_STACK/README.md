* linux :==

linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various operating systems, collectively known as the Linux distributions (or distros). it was created by linus Torvalds in the year 1991 and is built on the Unix principles, making it powerful and versatile.

KEY FEATURES OF LINUX:==
1. Open Source: The source code is freely available, allowin anyone to view, modify and distribute it.

2. Multiuser and Multitasking: Linux allows multiple users to operate simultaneously and run multiple applications at the same time.

3. Stability and Security: Known for its robustness, Linux is les prone to viruses and malware compared to other operating systems.

4 Customizability: Users can tailor their linux Enviroment to their needs, form the kernel to the user interface.

5. Variety of Distributions: There are many linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, and debian distros, each designed for different purposes, from destop use to server management.


======================================================================================================================================================================================
* Apache2:==
Apache2 commonly referred to as Apache, is widely used open-source webserver software. it plays a very important role in serving content over the internet. Here are some key features and details about Apache2.

1. Source Type: Apache2 is free to use and modify unlike some other softwares

2. Cross platform: it runs on various operating systems(linux, windows and macOS)

3. Configurable: allows for extensive configurations and customizations of server behaviours, including virtual hosts, security settings and performance tuning.

4. Architecture: Apache's functionality can be extended using modules. Users can enable or disable features as needed, such as URL rewriting , authentications, or SSL support

5. Multiple protocols: Primarily Uses HTTP, HTTPS and other protocols

Basic use :======

* Hosting of websites: apache is commonly used to host websites and serve web applications.

* Reverse Proxy : it can function as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to other servers.

* Development Enviroment: Many Developers use Apaceh to create a local webserver for testing and of services or applications

how to install
sudo apt install apache2 #install apache

after installation the following commands will start, stop and restart the service
sudo systemctl start apache2 # start service
sudo systemctl stop apache2 # stop service
sdo systemctl restart apache2 # restart servcice


======================================================================================================================================================================================
* Nginx:==
Nginx is a high-performance open-source web server and reverse proxy that is also used for HTTP cache and load balancing. Nginx is known for its efficiency, scalability and the ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections.

Features:
1. High performance: Nginx is designed to serve static and dynamic content faster and efficiently. it's event driven architecture allows it to handle many connections with low resource usage.

2. Reverse Proxy: Nginx can act as a reverse proxy, fowarding of clients requests to one or more servers which helps in load balancing and improving fault tolerance.

3. load Balancing: it supports various load balancing Methods( eg., round-robin, least connections) when it comes to distributing services among servers.

4. SSL/TLS support: nginx support robust secure connections for services including SSL/TLS termination(s).

5. Caching: it can cache content to reduce server loads and improve response times for frequently used requests resources.

6. Configurability: Nginx configuration is straightforward and flexible, allowing users to define server blocks for handling domains and applications.

7. Websocket: Nginx supports Websocket connections, making it suitable for real-time application(s)


common use of Nginx:

* web server: Nginx serves both static and dynamic content efficiently.

* Reverse Proxy: it is commonly used as a reverse proxy to distribut traffic among application

* Load balancer: Nginx can serve as a balancer/regulator of traffic to multiple back-end servers to ensure high availability.

* API Gateway: it can serve as An API(application programming interface) to manage and route api requests.

Installation guide: 
sudo apt install nginx

after installation run the following commands to start and run nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx # start the service
sudo systemctl stop nginx # stop the service
sudo systemctl restart nginx # restart the service


======================================================================================================================================================================================
* MySQL: ==
MySQL is relational database management system(RDMS) that uses a structured Query language(SQL) for accessing and managing of data. it is widely used for web applications and is a key component of the LAMP stack (Linux, apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/PERL).

Key features:
1. Relational database: Mysql organizes data into tables that can be linked by relationships, allowing for efficient data retrieval and management.

2. Open source: it is free to use and the source code is available for modification and distribution.

3. Cros-platform: Mysql runs on various operating systems (linux,windows and macOS)

4. high performanc: Mysql is known for it speeds and efficiency for handling large amounts of data and high-concurrency enviroments.

5. Scalability : it can handle large databases and support clustering for high availability and scalability.

6. Security: mysql provides security features like user authentication, SSL support and data encryption to protect sensitive information.

Common usases:

* creating of database(s)

installation guide

sudo apt install mysql-server
