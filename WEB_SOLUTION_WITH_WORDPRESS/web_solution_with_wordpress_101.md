#### Three-tier Architecture

+ Generally, web, or mobile solutions are implemented based on what is called the Three-tier Architecture.

##### Three-tier Architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers.

ï¿¼
+ Presentation Layer (PL): This is the user interface such as the client server or browser on your laptop.

+ Business Layer (BL): This is the backend program that implements business logic. Application or Webserver

+ Data Access or Management Layer (DAL): This is the layer for computer data storage and data access. Database Server or File System Server such as FTP server, or NFS Server
In this project, you will have the hands-on experience that showcases Three-tier Architecture while also ensuring that the disks used to store files on the Linux servers are adequately partitioned and managed through programs such as gdisk and LVM respectively.
